        "This project presents a robust, minimal, and user-friendly deep learning pipeline for the automated classification of brain MRI images into four clinically significant categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Leveraging the power of transfer learning, the solution is built upon the MobileNetV2 architecture, which is known for its efficiency and high accuracy, making it suitable for both research and practical deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The workflow begins with the preprocessing of MRI images, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance model generalization. The dataset is organized into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring a reliable evaluation of model performance. The training process incorporates best practices such as early stopping and model checkpointing, saving only the best-performing model based on validation accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "A key feature of this project is its interactive Streamlit web application, which allows users to upload one or multiple MRI images for instant classification. The app provides a comprehensive user experience by displaying image previews, prediction confidence scores, and Grad-CAM visualizations that highlight the regions of the MRI influencing the model’s decision. For each predicted class, the app presents medically relevant information, including typical symptoms, recommended precautions, and example prescriptions, sourced from reputable medical references. Users can also provide feedback on prediction accuracy, and download both the trained model and their prediction results as a CSV file.\n",
        "\n",
        "The codebase is modular, with clear separation between model definition, training, evaluation, and utility functions. This design ensures ease of maintenance and extensibility for future research or clinical adaptation. The project is accompanied by a detailed README, guiding users through setup, training, evaluation, and app deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project demonstrates how modern deep learning and user-centric design can empower medical professionals and researchers in the early detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI scans.\n"
